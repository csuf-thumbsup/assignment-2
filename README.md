#Great News! :+1: 

We have 2 versions of code for assignment 2 that produce the same result
*  Main.cpp - Modified version of the original code
*  Source.cpp - Modified version using vector and sstream

So it's really up to you guys to decide which one to use. I think it's cool that we have 2 different approaches that both work. That way for the next assignment it could be easier to modify one of the files since the work is already done.

Lastly! You should read through the Bug Fix that I made to Main.cpp to get it working. I think it can help to understand why the bug existed in the first place. [Bug Fix Link Here](https://github.com/csuf-thumbsup/assignment-2/issues/1)
## assignment-2
Write a program to read a postifx expression and compute its value. Variables are string of one or more characters and numbers are one or more digits. All tokens are separated with a single space.

###Sample I/O
```sh
Enter a postfix expression with a $ at the end: ab 22 * c + $

Enter the value of ab: 2

Enter the value of c: 4
Final Value: 48

Continue (y/n)? y
Enter a postfix expression with a $ at the end: tom jerry 123 + tom * - $

Enter the value of tom: 2

Enter the value of jerry: 3
Final Value: 250

Continue (y/n)?
```
